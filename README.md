INDIAN START-UP ECOSYSTEM FUNDING ANALYSIS(2018-2021)

PROJECT OVERVIEW
Welcome to the Indian Startup Ecosystem Funding Analysis project. This project aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the funding trends within the Indian startup landscape from 2018 to 2021. By analyzing data related to funding, we seek to identify patterns, identify key contributors, and offer insights into the financial dynamics that have shaped the start-up ecosystem during this period.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PROJECT

1. Scope of the Analysis
This analysis spans a crucial four-year period, coinciding with the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic, recognized as one of the most challenging health crises in modern history, significantly impacted economies worldwide, leading to a substantial slowdown and stagnation in economic activities. The reverberations of this unprecedented event are still being felt, with many economies working tirelessly to recover from the disruptions caused by the pandemic. The project aims to contextualize the funding trends within the Indian startup ecosystem against this backdrop, considering the unique challenges and opportunities that arose during the pandemic era. We delve into various dimensions, including regional concentrations, sectoral trends, and stages of funding.
2. Data Sources
The dataset is sourced from realiable sources through the AZUBI AFRICA BOOTCAMP database and CSV files provided by the body. These datasets encompass funding stages, regional distribution, industry sectors, and specific funding details for individual startups.
3. Key Objectives
Identify Funding Trends: Uncover trends and patterns in startup funding over the specified time frame.

Regional Concentrations: Analyze the distribution of startups across different regions, with a particular focus on Bengaluru as a significant hub.

Sectoral Insights: The sectors are grouped based on Global Industry Classification Standard into 11 Classes namely; Consumer Staples, Consumer Discretionary,Information Technology, Healthcare,Energy,Material,Real Estate, Industrials, Financials, Communication Services, Utilities. Under the sector category there is an Unknown category where other  controversial sectors are grouped. Examine funding dynamics within different industry sectors, with a spotlight on the Consumer Discretionary sector, Information Technology, Financials and other key sector categories.

Funding Stages: In this project the Funding Stages are grouped into five categories namely;
i. Pre-seed
ii. Seed
iii. Series A
iv. Series B,C,D & E and 
v. Others


Top Contributors: Identify and highlight startups that have secured the highest funding during the period, such as Reliance Retail Ventures Limited.

4. Hypothesis Testing
An additional layer of analysis includes hypothesis testing, which aims to determine if there is a significant relationship between the locations or headquarters of startups and the funding they attract. The findings will contribute valuable insights into the role of geography in shaping funding outcomes.
